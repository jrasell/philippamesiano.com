Philippa was Freelance Activity Plan Coordinator for the 2 year National Lottery
Heritage Funded Project: Restoring and Celebrating the Arts of Craftsmanship of
St Mary’s Church, Beddington.

Across the project, she developed and led a wide range of engagement projects
and activities in consultation with the St Mary’s PCC.

Her proudest moment was leading the Royal Female Orphanage Oral History and
Exhibition Project with support from Sutton Archives and Honeywood Museum.

The project shed new light on the Royal Female Orphanage, located at Carew
Manor in Beddington Park from 1866-1939, resulting in an exciting temporary
exhibition ‘Remembering the Royal Female Orphanage’ displayed at Honeywood
Museum, Upstairs Gallery Space, 3 August – 1 October 2022 &amp; Sutton Central
Library, Gallery Space, 23 November 2022 – 15 January 2023.
