Philippa worked for 1 year on the National Lottery Heritage Funded Project
Murston Heart: shaping a new future for Murston Old Church as the Freelance
History Projects Coordinator.

She really enjoyed researching, developing and leading creative, site-specific
activities and events for schools and public audiences in consultation with the
Murston All Saints Trust Trustees.

Her proudest moment was leading the Medieval Graffiti Project for Sunny Bank
Primary School:

*In June and July 2023, the Murston Heart team, led by the team’s History
Projects Coordinator Dr Philippa Mesiano, ran the Medieval Graffiti Project with
Sunny Bank Primary School.*

*Dr Mesiano delivered a whole school assembly about Medieval Graffiti in
Murston. Later, Sunny Bank pupils visited Murston New Church, using torches to
search for Medieval Graffiti on stone pillars which had once been located in
Murston Old Church. They learnt about the history of these marks, the carving of
which was often linked to devotional practice in the Medieval Period.*

*The classes then walked to the Murston Heart site to draft and paint their own
tile, inspired by different Medieval Graffiti designs. The painted tiles were
sent to Little Potters, Pottery Painting Studio to be glazed and fired in a kiln
and finally, exhibited in Murston Heart’s Chancel Gallery.*

Sunny Bank’s Head of School, Mr Allen said: *"This was a significant experience
for our children and I believe, from what I saw, the children have benefited not
just academically, but in terms of their moral and cultural development. We are
so lucky to have this rich local history and we are grateful of your time and
expertise to make this happen. We are changing lives at Sunny Bank Primary
School and this project has definitely contributed to this."*
